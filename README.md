# Formula1Won: Self-Driving Car Simulation

A beautiful, interactive simulation of a self-driving car navigating through traffic.

## üöÄ Live Demo

Check out the live simulation: [Formula1Won Demo](https://formula1won.netlify.app/)

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **Select a Configuration**: Choose from 5 different traffic scenarios
2. **Start the Simulation**: Watch the self-driving car (white) navigate to its goal
3. **Controls**:
   - Start: Begin the simulation
   - Pause/Resume: Pause or continue the simulation
   - Reset: Start over with a new configuration

## üîç Features

- Beautiful blue gradient background with visual effects
- Realistic car movement with collision avoidance
- Multiple traffic scenarios to test different conditions
- Real-time path visualization
- Step counter and position tracking

## üß† How It Works

The simulation uses a simple but effective pathfinding algorithm to navigate the self-driving car (agent) through traffic:

1. **Environment**: The simulation creates a 30√ó30 grid world with roads, intersections, and other vehicles.

2. **Pathfinding**: The agent uses a greedy approach to move toward the goal, prioritizing either horizontal or vertical movement based on which direction has the greater distance to cover.

3. **Collision Avoidance**: When the agent detects a potential collision with another vehicle, it attempts to change its path by trying the alternative direction (horizontal instead of vertical or vice versa).

4. **Visualization**: The simulation renders the environment using HTML5 Canvas, with smooth animations and visual effects to enhance the user experience.

## üèóÔ∏è How It's Built

The project is built using vanilla web technologies without any frameworks:

1. **HTML5 Canvas**: Used for rendering the entire simulation, including the grid, cars, and visual effects.

2. **JavaScript**: Powers the simulation logic, including:
   - Agent movement and decision-making
   - Other vehicles' random movement
   - Collision detection
   - Path tracking and visualization

3. **CSS**: Creates a responsive and visually appealing UI with:
   - Gradient backgrounds
   - Card-based layout for configuration selection
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Visual effects like shadows and transitions

The simulation runs entirely in the browser with no backend dependencies, making it fast and easy to deploy.
